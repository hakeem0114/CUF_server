# CUF_server 

## REST API For Student Enrollmemt Information on Ontario Universities
Used cheerio & axios to scrape references for data in order to create
an API for my UI

# Libraries & Packages Used

Cheerio
```
 A fast headless browser (does not render actual UI )  that is DOM parser without executing Javascript on the webpages, unlike Puppeteer.
```

Axios
```
Better alternative (in built support for download progress, more secure, error handling, cancelling request and their timeouts) to fetch API for http req with node & js
```

The rest are standard node libraries for server
